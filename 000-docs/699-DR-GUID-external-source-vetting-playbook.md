# External-Source Vetting Playbook (Contributors + Maintainers)

## Purpose

The [sync threat model](698-TQ-SECU-external-sync-threat-model.md) is blunt about the limits
of the machine layers: pinning proves content unchanged, not benign; the scanner recognizes
shapes of badness, not badness. **The human decisions are the actual security boundary.**
This playbook is the operating procedure for those decisions: what the flags gate, what a
maintainer checks before listing a source, how drift review works, how a scan CHALLENGE is
signed off, and how the surface tiers scale the scrutiny.

Machine enforcement lands via the sibling branches `feat/sync-lockfile-pinning` and
`feat/sync-security-scan` (umbrella: issue #966). Where this playbook and those
implementations differ on mechanics, the merged code is authoritative — update this doc.

## The two flags — what `verified` and `curated` actually gate

Orthogonal by design (full rationale: the mirror-by-default decision record):

| Flag | What it means | What it mechanically does |
|---|---|---|
| `verified: true` | A maintainer completed the listing checklist below and vouches for the source's trust and quality **at listing time**. | It is a **trust record, not a control** — the sync engine does not branch on it. It feeds catalog trust-level display (SECURITY.md § Plugin Trust Levels) and is the precondition for listing at the `scripted` or `hooks-mcp` tiers. |
| `curated: true` | We locally hardened the plugin past its upstream. | **Freezes the mirror entirely** — no clone, no write, no orphan-prune, even under `--force`. Only the catalog entry stays current. The standing off-ramp is upstreaming the improvement, then dropping the flag. |

Honest corollaries:

- `verified: true` decays. It is one person's judgment at one moment; every later upstream
  change is covered by the drift-quarantine review, not by the original vet.
- `curated: true` is a curation tool that doubles as the strongest security control we have —
  it severs the upstream write path. It is legitimate to apply it defensively to a
  `hooks-mcp`-tier source whose upstream you want to advance only by deliberate re-baseline.

## Surface-tier policy

Every source is classified by the **highest-risk surface its include globs admit** — the tier
follows the file list, never the author's description. A source with no explicit tier is
classified from the surface actually present in its mirror, defaulting to the highest surface
found (classification fails closed; the sync itself keeps working).

| Tier | Admits | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| `markdown-only` | `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `references/**`, other prose/docs | Routine path: drift quarantine + scan + standard review. The residual vector is prompt injection (threat model V4) — the drift reviewer **reads the changed instructions as instructions**, not as prose. |
| `scripted` | markdown-only + shell / Python / JS the skill invokes (mirrored with executable bits preserved) | Drift review reads **every changed script line**. Scan REFUSE patterns bind hardest here. Any new network endpoint, env access, or file write outside the plugin's own tree must be justified in the review before merge. |
| `hooks-mcp` | scripted + `hooks/**`, `.mcp.json`, `mcp-server/**` | Highest blast radius — these execute **automatically** in users' agents. Every drift requires explicit human re-approval (the quarantine PR may not be merged on green checks alone); each MCP `command`/`url` and each hook command is justified per entry, per change. Consider `curated: true` freeze-handling for sources here whose upstream churns. |

Tier changes are one-way-hard: moving a source **up** a tier (its globs start admitting
scripts or hooks) is a new listing decision — run the full checklist below again. Moving down
(narrowing globs) needs only a normal PR review.

## Before adding a source to `sources.yaml` — the listing checklist

The PR that adds a source is the vet. Every item below is evidence in that PR's description
or review thread; `verified: true` asserts all of them were done.

1. **Author identity and track record.** Real account with organic history: account age,
   other repositories, external corroboration (site, npm, community presence). A fresh
   account shipping a polished plugin is a flag, not a disqualifier — it raises the bar on
   every following step.
2. **Typosquat check.** The plugin name is not confusable with an existing catalog entry or
   a well-known plugin elsewhere (threat model V5, catalog-level). Check
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.extended.json` for near-collisions before anything else.
3. **License.** Explicit, present upstream, compatible with redistribution in this
   marketplace, and recorded in the source entry.
4. **Read everything the globs admit.** At the commit you are vetting, read every file that
   will match the `include` patterns — not just SKILL.md. Scripts line-by-line; hook and MCP
   configs command-by-command; every network endpoint accounted for and documented in the
   review. If it is too much to read, the include list is too wide (next item).
5. **Least-privilege globs.** Include only what the plugin needs to function. Never blanket
   `**`. Exclude tests, CI, dotfiles, lockfiles. If the plugin works markdown-only, do not
   sync its scripts — the tier follows the globs, and narrower globs are a smaller attack
   surface forever after.
6. **Assign the tier honestly** per the table above, from what the globs admit.
7. **Dry-run the sync.** `node scripts/sync-external.mjs --dry-run --source=<name>` —
   confirm the file list matches what you read in step 4, and that no "unsupported glob"
   warnings fire (a dead glob is a silent no-op rule).
8. **Run the security scan** over the mirrored tree. REFUSE findings end the listing until
   fixed upstream — no exceptions, no allowlist. CHALLENGE findings are signed off per the
   procedure below, in the same PR. FLAG findings are acknowledged in the review thread.
9. **Set `verified: true` last**, after 1–8, in the same PR, so the flag and its evidence
   land together. The lockfile entries for the source bootstrap from exactly this vetted
   content — the vet commit is the baseline every future drift is measured against.

Contributor-facing conduct throughout (friendly-issue-first, credit preserved, Jeremy's
wording sign-off on any contributor-facing post) is governed by the mirror-by-default
decision record § Respectful-contributor protocol.

## Lockfile drift review — the quarantine PR

With pinning in place (branch `feat/sync-lockfile-pinning`), the weekly sync compares every
mirrored file's hash against `sources.lock.json`:

- **Match** → the source flows into the routine sync PR, as today.
- **Drift** → the source is held out into its **own quarantine PR**: that source's diff only,
  plus the corresponding lock update. Small, single-origin, readable.

**Reviewing a quarantine PR:**

1. Read the diff as if it were a brand-new submission of the changed files — the original
   vet does not transfer to new content.
2. Scale scrutiny by tier: prose changes → read as instructions (V4); script changes → every
   line; hook/MCP changes → per-entry justification and explicit re-approval, never merged
   on green checks alone.
3. Sanity-check the upstream story: does the change correspond to organic upstream activity
   (commits, release notes, an issue it fixes)? A large unexplained rewrite, a force-push, or
   a brand-new committer on a stable repo warrants slowing down, not just reading harder.
4. Watch the classic escalations: new network endpoints, env/credential access, encoded or
   minified blobs, `allowed-tools` widening, new executable files, glob-boundary creep.
5. **Merging the quarantine PR is the re-vet.** The lock update inside it is the durable
   approval record — who approved, when, which hashes. Never hand-edit the lockfile to
   silence drift without reading the diff; that converts the approval record into a lie.

If the drift is unwanted (upstream went a direction we don't ship): close the quarantine PR
and either drop the source, narrow its globs, or freeze it `curated: true` pending an
upstream conversation.

## Signing off a scan CHALLENGE

The scanner (branch `feat/sync-security-scan`) grades findings so the gate stays credible —
an ungraded gate produces a false-positive storm and gets disabled:

| Verdict | Meaning | Override path |
|---|---|---|
| **REFUSE** | Known-hostile shape (pipe-to-shell, encoded exec, credential exfil). | **None.** Fix upstream or don't ship the content. REFUSE is not allowlistable. |
| **CHALLENGE** | Legitimate-capable but dangerous-capable (network calls in scripts, env harvesting, hook/MCP changes, `allowed-tools` expansion). | Blocked until a human adds a **scoped allowlist entry**. |
| **FLAG** | Suspicious-but-explainable (obfuscation smells, minified blobs). | Non-blocking; acknowledged in the PR review thread. |

**Allowlist discipline** (the exact file location and entry format live with the scanner —
see the `feat/sync-security-scan` PR):

1. An entry is scoped as narrowly as the scanner allows — this source, this file, this
   pattern. Never a blanket pattern-wide or source-wide waiver.
2. Every entry carries a justification ("posts release notes to the author's own API,
   documented in their README"), the reviewer's handle, and the date.
3. The allowlist is code: it changes only by reviewed PR, and the sign-off entry should land
   in the same PR as the content it excuses, so approval and evidence stay attached.
4. **Prune it.** An allowlist that only grows becomes a rubber stamp (threat model, residual
   risk #3). When a source is removed or its globs narrow, its entries go too; stale entries
   found during any review are deleted on sight.

## Suspending or removing a source

When an upstream is compromised, goes hostile, or simply dies:

1. **Stop the bleeding.** If a poisoned sync PR is open, close it. If it merged, revert the
   merge commit first, ask questions after.
2. **Cut the source.** Remove its entry from `sources.yaml` (or, for a temporary hold,
   freeze it `curated: true` — note that freezing keeps the current mirror published, so it
   is only appropriate when the *current* content is trusted and it's the *future* you're
   blocking).
3. **Remove the mirror.** Delete the plugin directory and its catalog entry in
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.extended.json`; run the lint-ignore generator so the managed
   exclusion block stays in sync.
4. **Clean the records.** Drop the source's lockfile entries and any scan-allowlist entries.
5. **Disclose.** If users may have installed poisoned content, this is a vulnerability:
   private advisory per SECURITY.md, then a public advisory naming affected plugin versions
   once users can act on it. No public issue before the advisory.

## Review discipline — the anti-fatigue rules

The whole defense degrades to theater if review becomes ritual. Standing rules:

- **Small units or no merge.** The quarantine model exists so no one reviews a 100-file
  multi-source diff again. If a quarantine PR is still too big to actually read, that is a
  reason to freeze or drop the source, not to skim.
- **Green checks are the floor, not the decision** — especially at `hooks-mcp` tier, where
  explicit human re-approval is the gate by policy.
- **Say "no" cheaply.** Closing a quarantine PR costs nothing; the next sync regenerates the
  proposal. The default answer to an unreadable or unexplained drift is no.
- **The audit trail is load-bearing.** Vet evidence in listing PRs, lock updates as approval
  records, justified allowlist entries — these are what let the *next* maintainer trust the
  state of the mirror without re-deriving it from diffs.
