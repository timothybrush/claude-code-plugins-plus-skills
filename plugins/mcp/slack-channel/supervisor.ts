/**
 * supervisor.ts — Session supervisor interface for the MCP server.
 *
 * This file is the Epic 32-B entry point. It declares the shape of the
 * SessionSupervisor actor — the single component allowed to create,
 * transition, or destroy sessions — without providing a runtime. The
 * activate / quiesce / deactivate implementations land in sibling beads
 * (ccsc-xa3.2, ccsc-xa3.3, and the deactivate + reaper beads under
 * ccsc-xa3.14). See 000-docs/session-state-machine.md §221-267 for the
 * full behavioural contract this interface pins down, and Armstrong
 * (2003) for the supervisor / lifecycle pattern it borrows from.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 *   - **Actor, not a library.** Every mutation of a live session flows
 *     through a single SessionSupervisor owned by server.ts. lib.ts
 *     primitives (sessionPath, saveSession, loadSession) are called only
 *     from here. A session file written by any other path is a bug.
 *
 *   - **One mutex per session file.** Two Slack threads in the same
 *     channel are independent; their handles carry independent mutexes.
 *     The supervisor guarantees serialised `update()` calls per key, not
 *     per channel.
 *
 *   - **Crash is not data loss.** The on-disk file is the source of
 *     truth. In-memory handles are caches. If the process crashes mid-
 *     flight, the next inbound event for that key re-enters Activating
 *     and re-reads the file (see session-state-machine.md §239-247).
 *
 *   - **No policy, no gate, no journal.** The supervisor decides when a
 *     session is loaded, held, flushed, or quarantined — it does not
 *     decide who can speak (inbound gate), which tools run (Epic 29-B),
 *     or what gets logged (Epic 30-A). Those subsystems observe session
 *     state; they never mutate it.

 *                       section. Callers of activate() observe this only
 *                       through the returned Promise resolving.
 *    - `active`       — handle is live, `session` reflects the on-disk
 *                       file after the most recent `update()`.
 *    - `quiescing`    — refusing new work; pending writes still flushing.
 *                       `update()` rejects.
 *    - `deactivating` — last flush resolved; handle about to be released.
 *                       Terminal from the caller's perspective.
 *    - `quarantined`  — save or load failure; supervisor filed a beads
 *                       issue and will not auto-reload. Only a human
 *                       (SO) clears this; see session-state-machine.md
