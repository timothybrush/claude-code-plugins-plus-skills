# Anima Skill Pack

> Production-grade Anima workflows for authorized Figma, website, and prompt-to-code operations (18 skills)

These skills use `@animaapp/anima-sdk` 0.27.0 and its current backend contract.
They cover Figma generation, public website conversion, early-preview prompt
generation, secure deployment, reliability, and governed output review. Current
framework targets are React and HTML; Vue is not advertised by this SDK version.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install anima-pack@claude-code-plugins-plus
```

## Key Concepts

- **Current SDK** — Examples follow the public 0.27.0 implementation and documentation
- **Server-side only** — SDK runs on backend; never ship tokens to browser
- **Least privilege** — Figma access uses current granular scopes and approved source allowlists
- **Framework support** — React or HTML with `plain_css`, Tailwind, or inline styles
- **Review boundary** — Generated output is quarantined until path, dependency, security, build, and visual checks pass
